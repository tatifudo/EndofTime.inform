When getting to the airport, a tragic flood occurs and it looks to be killing everyone. You look around to see what you can do about it and in the corner of the room you see an inflatable raft which you think is a good idea to grab.

You take the raft, already inflated and hightail it out of there. There are three possible exits but you don&apos;t have a clue which to pick. You can either go East, South, or North. Choose Wisely.

When getting to the airport, a tragic flood occurs and it looks to be killing everyone. You look around to see what you can do about it and in the corner of the room you see an inflatable raft which you think is a good idea to grab.

You take the raft, already inflated and hightail it out of there. There are three possible exits but you don&apos;t have a clue which to pick. You can either go East, South, or North. Choose Wisely.

When getting to the airport, a tragic flood occurs and it looks to be killing everyone. You look around to see what you can do about it and in the corner of the room you see an inflatable raft which you think is a good idea to grab.

You take the raft, already inflated and hightail it out of there. There are three possible exits but you don&apos;t have a clue which to pick. You can either go East, South, or North. Choose Wisely.

Street

You can see Martha and Steve here.
